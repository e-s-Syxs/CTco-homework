To launch this program, you need to open it in a programing environment (I used eclipse to create it), then open 
the class "main" and run it (Ctrl + F11 by default).

To test the program, you have to enter the required fields when you run it, and compere the output with the expected result.
The result will be shown in the console, in your programing environment.
The program should be able to handle any number of inputs.
